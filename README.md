# Paysim-Fraud-Detection-using-VAE-and-BNN
The project is devided into 4 parts : 

1. Data pre-processing.
2. Data Augmentation using VAE.
3. Classification using BNN.
4. Results : 
    1. Exploring the parameters destributions and plotting examples.
    2. Model evaluation.
    
P.S : ameliorations which will be made to this notebook in the near future :
- demystificaiton of each model.
- re-training the models with the full dataset (12 million data points fully balanced) insead of 16K datapoints.
- and ofc cleaning and re-structuring for public usage.
